Materialized Views are in synchronization with the mutating stream - they are updated by a primary key as 
data flows through the system. The data is updated by a given key, and it represents the latest view of the 
data by key.

For example: vehicleID Z latest latitude and longitude is X and Y. As the vehicle moves, the latitude and 
longitude for the vehicleID are updated . The primary key is defined at creation time and is immutable.

Materialized Views can be created as mutating snapshots of the queried data result that is updated by a given 
key. The data is always the latest representation of itself by key (analogous to a primary key in most RDBMS systems).

You can query the Materialized Views using a GET request over REST, which returns a JSON response as 
"Content-Type: application/json". The queries are not defined at query time. Rather, they are curated, saved, and 
granted access through the Cloudera platform. You can configure a REST endpoint to query the Materialized View. 
Multiple query conditions can be created to allow various ways to query the same data. This is sometimes referred to 
as a 'pull query'.
